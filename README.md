# Boosted Greenhouses
The base-game greenhouses are nice and all... but I feel like Giants doesn't really "embrace" that users want it their way, not always the Giants way. In reality, I just wanted to have two greenhouses side by side facing the same way, with the pallets spawning to the outsides... is that so hard to ask? I figured, while I was in the code, I could just tweak a few settings here or there, add a few more spawn locations, make a custom icon... as usual it snowballed a bit.


## Description from the ModDesc

_Enjoy!_
